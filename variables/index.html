        <p>
         Before ES6, we only had one way to delcare a variable - <b>VAR</b> <br>
         Now we can use <b>CONST and LET.</b> <br>
         Var is <b>function scope</b> but CONST and LET are <b>block scope</b>
        </p> <br>
        <h4>VAR</h4>
        <p>We can <b>
            define, update and redefine </b> this method of defining a variable . </p>

       
        <h4>LET</h4>
        <p>Again, we can define and update with the LET method, however we cannot <b>redefine</b> like we can with VAR.</p>
        <h4>CONST</h4>
       <p> As the term suggests, we use <b>CONST</b> for data than will never change. For example, boiling point of water, PI, freezing point of water... </p>
       <p>However, if it is a reference type (see example), then we can change the data.</p>
